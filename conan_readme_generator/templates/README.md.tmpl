\#\# For Users: Use this package

\#\#\# Basic setup

    $ conan install ${name}/${version}@${user}/${channel}

\#\#\# Project setup

If you handle multiple dependencies in your project is better to add a *conanfile.txt*

    [requires]
    ${name}/${version}@${user}/${channel}

#if $generators
    [generators]
#for $gen in $generators
    ${gen}
#end for
#end if

Complete the installation of requirements for your project running:

    $ mkdir build && cd build && conan install ..

Note: It is recommended that you run conan install from a build directory and not the root of the project directory.  This is because conan generates *conanbuildinfo* files specific to a single build configuration which by default comes from an autodetected default profile located in ~/.conan/profiles/default .  If you pass different build configuration options to conan install, it will generate different *conanbuildinfo* files.  Thus, they should not be added to the root of the project, nor committed to git.

\#\# For Packagers: Publish this Package

The example below shows the commands used to publish to ${user} conan repository. To publish to your own conan respository (for example, after forking this git repository), you will need to change the commands below accordingly.

\#\# Build and package

The following command both runs all the steps of the conan file, and publishes the package to the local system cache.  This includes downloading dependencies from "build_requires" and "requires" , and then running the build() method.

    $ conan create ${user}/${channel}


#if $options
\#\#\# Available Options
| Option        | Default | Possible Values  |
| ------------- |:----------------- |:------------:|
#for $key, $value in $options.items()
#if $key not in $default_options
| ${key}      |                        |  ${value} |
#else
| ${key}      | $default_options[$key] |  ${value} |
#end if
#end for
#end if

\#\# Add Remote

    $ conan remote add ${user} "https://api.bintray.com/conan/${user}/public-conan"

\#\# Upload

    $ conan upload ${name}/${version}@${user}/${channel} --all -r ${user}
